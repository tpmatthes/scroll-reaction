# Scroll-Reaction.js

### Performant, dependency free and fully customizable scroll effects

Highlight the current section in your navigation, hide your header on scroll or let elements appear with beautiful CSS transitions ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy with _Scroll-Reaction.js_.

# Why do I need it?

Let‚Äôs face it: We develop a lot of single page websites these days. Most of them need some sort of navigation, where the current section is highlighted. And they need smooth scrolling, too.

It can be a tedious task: It involves listening to scroll and resize events, updating DOM elements and thinking about many stress cases (e.g. unreachable sections, keyboard accessibility, reduced motion media query). And did I mention the perfomance issues of an un-throttled callback function?

You probably don‚Äôt want to think about that, and you don‚Äôt want to pull in a huge library either.

Introducing _Scroll-Reaction.js_ ‚Äì a tiny JavaScript library for ridiculously easy scroll effects.

**Some benefits:**

- ready to use in less than a minute
- very small file size (~ 1KB gzipped)
- dependency free
- optimized for performance
- fully customizable, if you need it

# Installation

## Option 1: Browser

Download it here: [scroll-reaction.min.js](https://github.com/tpmatthes/scroll-reaction/releases/download/v1.3.4/scroll-reaction.zip)

Include the basic version in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="scroll-reaction.min.js"></script>
```

Read [Getting started](#getting-started), scroll and party! üéâ

## Option 2: Node.js (build tools)

Use npm to install _Scroll-Reaction.js_ in your project:

```bash
$ npm install scroll-reaction
```

Include it:

```js
const ScrollReaction = require("scroll-reaction");
```

Done! üì¶

---

**Please note:** Most modern browsers still [don‚Äôt support scroll behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) for native smooth scrolling. The default version of _Scroll-Reaction.js_ doesn‚Äôt include a polyfill. If you need a polyfill, you can use the file `scroll-reaction-with-polyfill.min.js`.

# Getting started

Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre building a simple website with 3 sections:

```html
<section id="section-1">
  ...
</section>
<section id="section-2">
  ...
</section>
<section id="section-3">
  ...
</section>
```

We want to add a navigation, where the link to the current section is highlighted. For that purpose we add some markup with _Scroll-Reaction.js_-specific data attributes:

```html
<nav>
  <a href="#section-1" data-scroll-reaction>Section 1</a>
  <a href="#section-2" data-scroll-reaction>Section 2</a>
  <a href="#section-3" data-scroll-reaction>Section 3</a>
</nav>
```

Afterwards we include _Scroll-Reaction.js_ in the HTML file before `</body>` and initialize it:

```html
<script src="scroll-reaction.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var reaction = new ScrollReaction();
</script>
```

Done! üòÆ

Now, if a user scrolls to one of our sections, the corresponding anchor tag receives a new attribute: `data-scroll-active`. Additionally, if the user clicks on a link, the browser will scroll smoothly to the destination.

It‚Äôs entirely up to you to add styling. _Scroll-Reaction.js_ only assigns attributes. You can use an attribute selector to assign CSS styles to active links:

```css
a[data-scroll-active] {
  /* ... */
}
```

# Examples

## ‚ÄúScroll to top‚Äù link

You can easily create a ‚Äúscroll to top‚Äù link with smooth scrolling. Just add a data attribute:

```html
<a href="#" data-scroll-reaction>Beam me up!</a>
```

_Scroll-Reaction.js_ is smart enough to read the `href` attribute and send the user to the right location. It even updates the URL with the correct hash.

## Animated appearance of elements

_Scroll-Reaction.js_ works well with links, but it can handle any kind of HTML element. You want to animate the appearance of an element? Do it:

```html
<section id="example" data-scroll-reaction="example">
  Animate me!
</section>
```

If there is no `href` attribute, you have to assign a value to the data attribute. _Scroll-Reaction.js_ finds the element with the given ID (emitter element). It then assigns the new attribute `data-scroll-active` to the element with the `data-scroll-reaction` attribute (listener element), if the user reaches the position of the emitter element. In this example `<section>` is both emitter and listener element.

Include _Scroll-Reaction.js_:

```html
<script src="scroll-reaction.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var reaction = new ScrollReaction({
    // Never remove attributes
    rewind: false
  });
</script>
```

And add some nice CSS transitions:

```css
#example[data-scroll-active] {
  transition: all 1s ease;
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

It‚Äôs easy! üéä

## Hide your header on scroll

Maybe you have a fixed header like this:

```html
<header id="example">Hide me!</header>
```

You can use the _Scroll-Reaction.js_ API to hide it after a certain amount of scrolling:

```html
<script src="scroll-reaction.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Get the header
  var header = document.getElementById("example");

  // Initialize Scroll Reaction
  var reaction = new ScrollReaction();

  reaction.on("update", function() {
    // Has the user scrolled too far?
    if (this.position > 999) {
      // Add a class to hide the header
      // You can easily animate it with CSS transitions
      header.classList.add("is-hidden");
    }
  });
</script>
```

Don‚Äôt forget to add some CSS for smooth transitions. ‚ú®

# Options

_Scroll-Reaction.js_ is fully customizable, if you need it.

You can pass a config object to the constructor function. These are the default values:

```js
var reaction = new ScrollReaction({
  /**
   * Explanation of terms
   *
   * Listener elements can be registered
   * by adding custom data attributes, e.g.
   * <a href="#section-1" data-scroll-reaction>...</a>
   *
   * Emitter elements are linked to listener elements
   * Usually the href attribute of a listener element should
   * match the id of the emitter element, e.g.
   * <section id="section-1">...</section>
   *
   * Scroll-Reaction.js works well with links,
   * but it can handle any kind of HTML element
   * If there is no href attribute, you have to assign
   * a value to the data attribute, e.g.
   * <h1 data-scroll-reaction="section-1">...</h1>
   */

  /**
   * This attribute is used to find listener elements
   * By default the href page anchor (e.g. href="#test")
   * will be used to identify emitter elements
   * However, you can set this attribute to a valid id,
   * if no href attribute exists
   * @type {String}
   *
   * @example
   * <a href="#section-1" data-scroll-reaction>...</a>
   * <section id="section-1">...</section>
   */
  attribute: "data-scroll-reaction",

  /**
   * This attribute will be added to listener elements,
   * if the user reaches an emitter element
   * If you pass an empty string or explicity set it to false,
   * no attribute will be added
   * It‚Äôs entirely up to you to add styling
   * Example: a[data-scroll-active] { ... }
   * @type {String}
   */
  attributeCurrent: "data-scroll-active",

  /**
   * This offset will be subtracted from the vertical position
   * of any emitter element before calculating the current scroll position
   * If your listener element should receive its attribute earlier,
   * you should pass a (much) higher value
   * @type {Number}
   */
  offset: 5,

  /**
   * If you enable this option, the base offset
   * will be calculated from the height of an element
   * This option accepts any query selector, e.g. '#navigation' or 'nav'
   * The first element, which matches the given selector, will be used
   * If you use both offset options, the base offset will be added to this
   * @type {String}
   */
  offsetFrom: "",

  /**
   * If the user scrolls past an emitter element,
   * all linked listener elements will get a new attribute
   * If the user scrolls back up or reaches another emitter element,
   * existing attributes will be removed immediately
   * Set this option to false to prevent removing of attributes
   * This can be used to create one-off animations for appearing elements
   * @type {Boolean}
   */
  rewind: true,

  /**
   * Should smooth scrolling be enabled for all listener elements?
   * Browser support is checked automatically, if set to 'auto'
   * If you use custom event listeners for your links,
   * you probably want to disable this option (= false)
   * Set this option to true, if you use your own polyfill
   * The script can only check for native support, not for polyfills
   * @type {Boolean}
   */
  smoothScroll: "auto",

  /**
   * The update method will get called at a limited rate on scroll
   * By default it will get called 10 times per second
   * This can limit the FPS in a custom update callback
   * Feel free to change it to a lower value, if that's the case
   * @type {Number}
   */
  throttleDelay: 100,

  /**
   * The last emitter element may be "unreachable" on bigger screens
   * Usually an emitter element is only triggered when the user scrolls past it
   * However, if the user scrolls to the bottom of the page,
   * the last emitter element will be activated automatically
   * If linked listener elements should receive their attributes earlier,
   * you should pass a (much) higher value
   * Negative values (<0) will make the last emitter element unreachable
   * Do you really want that?
   * @type {Number}
   */
  windowBottomOffset: 20
});
```

You can create as many instances as you like, even with (very) different configurations.

# API and Events

_Scroll-Reaction.js_ has a simple API:

```js
// Include scroll-reaction.min.js first!

// Basic Setup
var reaction = new ScrollReaction();

// Access the current scroll position in pixels at any time:
var pixels = reaction.position; // e.g. 750

// Access the current scroll position in percent at any time:
var percentage = reaction.status + "%"; // e.g. 75%

/**
 * Call this function on every update
 * This includes: scroll, resize and orientation change
 * In most cases, you don't need to register
 * your own event listeners for these events
 * Scroll-Reaction.js uses custom event listeners
 * with performance optimizations
 */
reaction.on("update", function() {
  // Available variables (see above)
  // this.position
  // this.status
});

/**
 * Call this function whenever the user clicks on a link
 * with a Scroll-Reaction.js data attribute (see config)
 * If smoothScroll is explicity set to false,
 * Scroll-Reaction.js won't add event listeners to links
 * In that case you should register your own event listeners
 */
reaction.on("click", function() {
  // Available variables (see above)
  // this.position
  // this.status
});

// If you add, reorder or delete emitter or listener elements,
// you should refresh the cache
reaction.refresh();

// If you add elements or change their height,
// you should update the position and the status
// Otherwise they will update when the next scroll event occurs
reaction.update();

// You want the browser to scroll to a specific element?
// Just pass the ID as an argument
reaction.scrollTo("my-id");

// Scroll to top
reaction.scrollTo();
```

If you run into trouble, feel free to post your questions in the
[issues section](https://github.com/tpmatthes/scroll-reaction/issues).

_Scroll-Reaction.js_ supports all modern browsers (requires [ES5](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5)). It doesn‚Äôt rely on ES6 features, so it should support a fair amount of older browsers as well ‚Äì even Internet Explorer 9+.

Most modern browsers still [don‚Äôt support scroll behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) for native smooth scrolling. The default version of _Scroll-Reaction.js_ doesn‚Äôt include a polyfill. If you need a polyfill, you can use the file `scroll-reaction-with-polyfill.min.js`.
